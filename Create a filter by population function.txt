ChatGPT
MuleSoft's Anypoint Exchange is a central hub for sharing assets such as connectors, templates, and APIs within or outside of an organization. Publishing an API to Anypoint Exchange can be done from the Design Center or directly from Anypoint Studio.

Here are the general steps for publishing an API to Anypoint Exchange:

Set Up Anypoint Platform Account:

If you haven't already, sign up for an Anypoint Platform account.
Navigate to Anypoint Exchange to make sure you have the necessary permissions to publish to the Exchange.
From Design Center:

Open your API Specification or RAML file in the Design Center.
Click on the "Publish" button.
Select "Publish to Exchange."
Fill in the necessary details such as asset type, version details, and main file (typically your main .raml file).
Click "Publish."
From Anypoint Studio:

In Studio, ensure that your API project is open.
Right-click on your project in the Project Explorer.
Select "Anypoint Platform" > "Publish to Exchange."
Log in with your Anypoint Platform credentials if prompted.
Fill in the necessary information for your API, like version, group, asset type, etc.
Click "Publish."
Verify in Anypoint Exchange:

Once published, navigate to Anypoint Exchange in your web browser.
Search for your API and verify that it's published correctly with all details.
Share and Use:

You can now share the link to your API on the Exchange with others.
Developers can discover, learn about, and request access to your API from the Exchange.
Versioning:

Whenever you make updates to your API, remember to increment the version before publishing to the Exchange to keep track of changes.
A few best practices:

Ensure your API specification is well-documented with examples, response types, and clear descriptions.
Add a README and other pertinent documentation when publishing to the Exchange, so users know how to consume and implement your API effectively.
Make sure you manage the versioning appropriately to avoid confusion.
Remember, the exact steps and options might vary based on the version of the Anypoint Platform or Studio you're using, so always refer to the official MuleSoft documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Write me documentation for app in Anypoint Exchange. It should be at least 2 paragraphs, 4-10 sentences long. App returns information about countries. You can filter countries by country name, population with query parameters. Also there is query parameter sort that sorts countries by name in ascending and descending order and offset and limit for pagination.

Country Information API Documentation
Overview
The Country Information API offers a comprehensive service that provides detailed information about countries worldwide. Our API collates data on various country-specific parameters, ensuring that users can access accurate and updated information with ease. Whether you're building an application that requires country-related data or simply wish to delve into geographical statistics, our API serves as the one-stop solution for all your needs.

Endpoint Details & Usage
To fetch data, make a GET request to /countries. The API provides several query parameters to tailor the data retrieval to your specifications:

countryName: Filter countries based on their name by providing a partial or full name. E.g., /countries?countryName=India.

population: Use this parameter to retrieve countries that match a specific population count. E.g., /countries?population=1000000 returns countries with populations of 1 million.

sort: Sort countries by name in either ascending (asc) or descending (desc) order. By default, the list is in ascending order. E.g., /countries?sort=desc.

offset & limit: Implement pagination in your data retrieval process. The offset parameter specifies where to start, and limit indicates the number of countries to return. For instance, /countries?offset=10&limit=5 would skip the first 10 countries and return the next 5.

For optimal performance and specificity in your queries, you can combine multiple parameters. For example, /countries?countryName=Ind&population=1000000&sort=asc&offset=0&limit=10 would fetch the first ten countries starting with "Ind" and having a population of 1 million, sorted in ascending order by name.

Note: This documentation provides a basic overview and usage guidance. Depending on the application's complexity and features, you might need to include additional details, such as error responses, rate limits, authentication methods, etc.
