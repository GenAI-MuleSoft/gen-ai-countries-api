I need to write README.md about to specifications that I have in Anypoint exchange. One of them returns info about countries and another one about countries and cities.Results can be filtered by country or city name and population, sorted in ascending or descending order by name. Also you have pagination with offset and limit. Write it to me and take into account that in README.md on github double spaces are considered a new line character.

Certainly! Here's a suggested README.md for your specifications in Anypoint Exchange:

Anypoint Exchange Specifications
Welcome to the Anypoint Exchange specifications documentation. We offer two APIs: one for fetching information about countries and another for fetching details on countries and their cities. Each API has comprehensive filtering, sorting, and pagination options to provide optimal flexibility.

Table of Contents
Countries API
Countries and Cities API
Common Features
Countries API
Endpoint: /api/countries

Usage:
Fetch details about various countries.

Parameters:
name: Filter countries by name.
population: Filter countries by population.
Countries and Cities API
Endpoint: /api/countries-cities

Usage:
Fetch details about countries and their corresponding cities.

Parameters:
countryName: Filter by country name.
cityName: Filter by city name.
population: Filter countries/cities by population.
Common Features
Sorting:
Both APIs offer the ability to sort results by name in either ascending or descending order:

sort: name-asc or name-desc
Pagination:
Fetch results in a paginated manner to better handle large data sets:

offset: Specifies the starting point of the results to fetch.
limit: Specifies the maximum number of results to return.
Example:
To fetch information about countries starting from the 10th result and limit to 20 results:

bash
Copy code
/api/countries?offset=10&limit=20
To fetch information about countries and cities, filtered by city name "Los Angeles":

bash
Copy code
/api/countries-cities?cityName=Los_Angeles
Feedback
We are always eager to improve and expand our specifications. Please feel free to provide feedback or report any issues you may encounter.

Remember, when writing this on GitHub, using two spaces at the end of a line will be considered as a new line character. Adjust as necessary and customize further based on your requirements and any other specific details about the APIs.

Certainly!

Countries API in Runtime Manager
The Countries API hosted in the Runtime Manager is a robust service providing detailed information about various countries. For enhanced security, the API is protected using Basic Authentication. Additionally, to ensure fair usage and system stability, rate limiting policies have been applied. Please ensure you authenticate properly and respect the rate limits when making requests.

You can add this section appropriately within your README.md to provide a concise description of your app in Runtime Manager.
